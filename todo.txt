- password and OTP: can you add a password feature. when i click the login nad input my email, it send my email a verification link and when i click on it, it takes me to the website logged in succesffully. but i never inputted a password. so can you make it so that the user will enter their email, then a password box will popup below, and then after they enter the password, it will send them an email with an 6 digit OTP. then on the website it will give them a spot to input the otp. once the otp is succesful, then it will load to the page with thtem logged in and allow the user to continue working.
